Important Points:
1. Block Elements: 
    - Block elements take up the full width of their container.
    - Examples: <article>, <aside>, <nav>, <footer>, <address>, <section>.

2. Inline Elements: 
    - Inline elements only take up as much width as their content.
    - Examples: <label>, <input>, <span>, <em>, <button>, <a>.

3. Inline-Block Elements:
    - Inline-block elements behave like inline elements, but they respect width and height.
    - Example: A <div> with 'display: inline-block'.

4. Display Property:
    - The CSS 'display' property controls the layout behavior of an element.
    - Common values: 'block', 'inline', 'inline-block', 'none'.

5. Visibility:
    - 'display: none' hides the element, and it does not occupy any space.

6. Tags like <hr>, <p>, <ul>, and <img> are commonly used with different display properties.

7. HTML structure includes <header>, <main>, and <footer> for semantic layout.
