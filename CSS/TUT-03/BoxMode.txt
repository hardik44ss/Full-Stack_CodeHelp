CSS Border, Height, Width, and Box-Sizing Revision Notes
=========================================================

1. **Border Property:**
   - The `border` property defines the area surrounding the content and padding.
   - Example: `border: 5px solid black;`
   - Variants include solid, dotted, dashed, etc.
   - You can round the border using `border-radius`.

2. **Width and Height Properties:**
   - `width` and `height` define the size of an element.
   - These can be specified in units like px, %, em, etc.
   - If using percentages, it adjusts relative to the parent container.
   - Example: `width: 200px; height: 100px;`

3. **Box-Sizing:**
   - Determines how the total width and height of an element are calculated.
   - `content-box` (default): Width and height apply only to the content.
   - `border-box`: Width and height include padding, border, keeping the total size consistent.
   - Example: 
     - `box-sizing: content-box;`
     - `box-sizing: border-box;`

4. **Why `border-box` is a good practice:**
   - It simplifies layout calculations.
   - It makes layouts more predictable.
   - Consistent sizing when adding padding and borders.
   - Better for responsive design.
